On behalf of the Teaclave community, I am happy to announce the release of
Teaclave TrustZone SDK 0.7.0.

Teaclave empowers developers to build memory-safe Trusted Applications across
diverse confidential computing platforms, including Intel SGX and Arm TrustZone.
Apache Teaclave TrustZone SDK, a subproject of Apache Teaclave, is based on the
OP-TEE project, a widely used open-source TrustZone OS.

This release updates the project to OP-TEE 4.8.0, introduces the std feature for
optee-utee to improve build-option flexibility, adds no-std support to several
examples, and delivers significant Build/CI enhancements. It also improves error
messages and expands the documentation.

For more details, please refer to our release notes:
