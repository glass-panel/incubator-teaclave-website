Each bucket is associated with a rule which determines whether or not a document in the falls into it. In other words, the buckets effectively define document sets. Buckets are not necessarily disjunct, therefore a document can fall into multiple buckets. In addition to the buckets themselves, the bucket aggregations also compute and return the number of documents for each bucket. Bucket aggregations, as opposed to metric aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations. These sub-aggregations will be aggregated for the buckets created by their “parent” bucket aggregation. There are different bucket aggregators, each with a different “bucketing” strategy. Some define a single bucket, some define fixed number of multiple buckets, and others dynamically create the buckets during the aggregation process."],["RangeAggregation","Provide user-defined buckets to aggregate on. Two special buckets will automatically be created to cover the whole range of values. The provided buckets have to be continuous. During the aggregation, the values extracted from the fast_field `field` will be checked against each bucket range.
