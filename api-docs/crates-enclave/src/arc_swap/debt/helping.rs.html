//!
//! This is inspired (but not an exact copy) of
//! &lt;https://pvk.ca/Blog/2020/07/07/flatter-wait-free-hazard-pointers/&gt;. The debts are mostly
//! copies of the ones used by the hybrid strategy, but modified a bit. Just like in the hybrid
//! strategy, in case the slots run out or when the writer updates the value, the debts are paid by
//! incrementing the ref count (which is a little slower, but still wait-free/lock-free and still
//! in order of nanoseconds).
//!
//! ## Reader, the fast path
//!
//! * Publish an active address ‒ the address we&#39;ll be loading stuff from.
//! * Puts a generation into the control.
//! * Loads the pointer and puts it to the debt slot.
//! * Confirms by CaS-replacing the generation back to idle state.
//!
//! * Later, we pay it back by CaS-replacing it with the NO_DEPT (like any other slot).
//!
//! ## Writer, the non-colliding path
//!
//! * Replaces the pointer in the storage.
//! * The writer walks over all debts. It pays each debt that it is concerned with by bumping the
//!   reference and replacing the dept with NO_DEPT. The relevant reader will fail in the CaS
//!   (either because it finds NO_DEPT or other pointer in there) and knows the reference was
//!   bumped, so it needs to decrement it. Note that it is possible that someone also reuses the
//!   slot for the _same_ pointer. In that case that reader will set it to NO_DEPT and the newer
//!   reader will have a pre-paid debt, which is fine.
//!
//! ## The collision path
//!
//! The reservation of a slot is not atomic, therefore a writer can observe the reservation in
//! progress. But it doesn&#39;t want to wait for it to complete (it wants to be lock-free, which means
//! it needs to be able to resolve the situation on its own).
//!
//! The way it knows it is in progress of the reservation is by seeing a generation in there (it has
//! a distinct tag). In that case it&#39;ll try to:
//!
//! * First verify that the reservation is being done for the same address it modified, by reading
//!   and re-confirming the active_addr slot corresponding to the currently handled node. If it is
//!   for some other address, the writer doesn&#39;t have to be concerned and proceeds to the next slot.
//! * It does a full load. That is fine, because the writer must be on a different thread than the
//!   reader and therefore there is at least one free slot. Full load means paying the debt right
//!   away by incrementing the reference count.
//! * Then it tries to pass the already fully protected/paid pointer to the reader. It writes it to
//!   an envelope and CaS-replaces it into the control, instead of the generation (if it fails,
//!   someone has been faster and it rolls back). We need the envelope because the pointer itself
//!   doesn&#39;t have to be aligned to 4 bytes and we need the space for tags to distinguish the types
//!   of info in control; we can ensure the envelope is).
//! * The reader then finds the generation got replaced by a pointer to the envelope and uses that
//!   pointer inside the envelope. It aborts its own debt. This effectively exchanges the envelopes
//!   between the threads so each one has an envelope ready for future.
//!
//! ## ABA protection
//!
//! The generation as pre-reserving the slot allows the writer to make sure it is offering the
//! loaded pointer to the same reader and that the read value is new enough (and of the same type).
//!
//! This solves the general case, but there&#39;s also much less frequent but theoretical ABA problem
//! that could lead to UB, if left unsolved:
//!
//! * There is a collision on generation G.
//! * The writer loads a pointer, bumps it.
//! * In the meantime, all the 2^30 or 2^62 generations (depending on the usize width) generations
//!   wrap around.
//! * The writer stores the outdated and possibly different-typed pointer in there and the reader
//!   uses it.
//!
//! To mitigate that, every time the counter overflows we take the current node and un-assign it
//! from our current thread. We mark it as in &quot;cooldown&quot; and let it in there until there are no
//! writers messing with that node any more (if they are not on the node, they can&#39;t experience the
//! ABA problem on it). After that, we are allowed to use it again.
//!
//! This doesn&#39;t block the reader, it&#39;ll simply find *a* node next time ‒ this one, or possibly a
//! different (or new) one.
//!
//! # Orderings
//!
//! The linked lists/nodes are already provided for us. So we just need to make sure the debt
//! juggling is done right. We assume that the local node is ours to write to (others have only
//! limited right to write to certain fields under certain conditions) and that we are counted into
//! active writers while we dig through it on the writer end.
//!
//! We use SeqCst on a read-write operation both here at the very start of the sequence (storing
//! the generation into the control) and in the writer on the actual pointer. That establishes a
//! relation of what has happened first.
//!
//! After that we split the time into segments by read-write operations with AcqRel read-write
//! operations on the control. There&#39;s just one control in play for both threads so we don&#39;t need
//! SeqCst and the segments are understood by both the same way. The writer can sometimes use only
//! load-Acquire on that, because it needs to only read from data written by the reader. It&#39;ll
//! always see data from at least the segment before the observed control value and uses CaS to
//! send the results back, so it can&#39;t go into the past.
//!
//! There are two little gotchas:
//!
//! * When we read the address we should be loading from, we need to give up if the address does
//!   not match (we can&#39;t simply load from there, because it can be dangling by that point and we
//!   don&#39;t know its type, so we need to use our address for all loading ‒ and we just check they
//!   match). If we give up, we don&#39;t do that CaS into control, therefore we could have given up on
//!   newer address than the control we have read. For that reason, the address is also stored by
//!   reader with Release and we read it with Acquire, which&#39;ll bring an up to date version of
//!   control into our thread ‒ and we re-read that one to confirm the address is indeed between
//!   two same values holding the generation, therefore corresponding to it.
//! * The destructor doesn&#39;t have a SeqCst in the writer, because there was no write in there.
//!   That&#39;s OK. We need to ensure there are no new readers after the &quot;change&quot; we confirm in the
//!   writer and that change is the destruction ‒ by that time, the destroying thread has exclusive
//!   ownership and therefore there can be no new readers.
